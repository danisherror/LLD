# Method 1
-----------------
## 1. Clarify Requirements 
- Ask questions to understand the full scope of the problem 
- Identify the core features and basic flows 
- Clarify edge cases and constraints 
- Agree on assumptions if requirements are vague 
---

## 2. Define Core Objects/Classes 
- Identify the high level objects/classes needed based on requirements 
- Consider entities like User, Order, Product etc.
- Outline key attributes for each class 
- Keep it high level at this stage 
---
## 3. Establish Relationships Between Objects
- Map out how the core classes would interact with each other 
- Note the direction of communication between objects 
- Define clean interfaces for how objects will collaborate/exchange data
- Consider 1-1, 1-many, inheritance relationships 
----
## 4. Define Required Functionality 
- Outline main methods/functions needed in each class 
- Focus on core functionality at first 
- Provide method signatures, inputs and outputs 
- Consider class scope, access modifiers
