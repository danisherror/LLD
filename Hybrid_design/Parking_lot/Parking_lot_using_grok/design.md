Below is a list of the classes in the improved parking lot system, along with the design patterns used for each and the rationale for their application. The system is designed to meet all requirements (multiple floors, multiple entry/exit gates, multiple vehicle types, ticket generation, payment modes, hourly/minute billing, proximity allocation) while ensuring scalability, maintainability, and adherence to SOLID principles.

### Classes and Design Patterns

1. **Class: Vehicle**
   - **Design Pattern**: Abstract Product (Abstract Factory Pattern)
   - **Why**: `Vehicle` is an abstract class defining the interface for vehicles (`Car`, `Bike`, `HeavyVehicle`). It’s part of the Abstract Factory Pattern to allow the creation of different vehicle types without specifying their concrete classes, enabling extensibility for new vehicle types (e.g., `Truck`).

2. **Class: Car**

    - **Why**: Static utility to select the appropriate `ParkingFactory` based on `VehicleType`, centralizing factory selection logic and enabling extensibility for new vehicle types.

16. **Class: Ticket**
    - **Design Pattern**: Concrete Product (Abstract Factory Pattern)
    - **Why**: Represents a parking ticket, created by `ParkingFactory`, containing vehicle, spot, floor, and gate information. It’s part of the Abstract Factory Pattern to ensure type-consistent ticket creation.

17. **Class: TicketBuilder**
    - **Design Pattern**: Builder Pattern
    - **Why**: Facilitates the construction of `Ticket` objects with multiple attributes (`vehicle`, `spot`, `floorNumber`, `gateId`), improving code clarity and allowing easy addition of new ticket properties.

18. **Class: ParkingFloor**
    - **Design Pattern**: Observer Pattern (Behavioral) + Thread-Safe Design
    - **Why**: Manages parking spots for a specific vehicle type and floor, using `ReentrantLock` for thread-safe spot allocation (multiple gates). Implements the Observer Pattern to notify observers (e.g., `DisplayBoard`) of spot occupancy changes, ensuring real-time updates.

19. **Class: ParkingObserver**
    - **Design Pattern**: Observer Interface (Observer Pattern)
    - **Why**: Defines the interface for objects (e.g., `DisplayBoard`) that receive real-time availability updates from `ParkingFloor`, supporting scalable notifications for multiple clients (e.g., mobile apps).

20. **Class: DisplayBoard**

27. **Class: BillingMode**
    - **Design Pattern**: Enum (Supporting Strategy Pattern)
    - **Why**: Defines billing modes (`HOURLY`, `MINUTE`) to guide the `Payment` class, ensuring type-safe billing strategy selection.

28. **Class: Gate**
    - **Design Pattern**: Abstract Class (Template Pattern-like)
    - **Why**: Abstract base class for `EntryGate` and `ExitGate`, providing common attributes (`parkingLot`, `payment`, `gateId`). While not a strict Template Pattern, it standardizes gate behavior, reducing code duplication.

29. **Class: EntryGate**
    - **Design Pattern**: Client of Abstract Factory
    - **Why**: Uses `ParkingFactory` to create tickets and allocate spots, leveraging the Abstract Factory Pattern to ensure type-safe operations for vehicle entry.

30. **Class: ExitGate**
    - **Design Pattern**: Client of Strategy Pattern
    - **Why**: Uses `PaymentProcessor` and `BillingMode` to process payments, leveraging the Strategy Pattern for flexible payment and billing options at exit.

31. **Class: ParkingLotDemo**

    - **Why**: Demonstrates the system’s functionality by creating vehicles, gates, and scenarios, integrating all patterns without applying a specific pattern itself.

### Why This Hybrid Design?
- **Abstract Factory Pattern**: Best for creating families of related objects (vehicles, spots, tickets) for different vehicle types, ensuring extensibility for new types (e.g., `Truck` requires only new factory and classes).
- **Builder Pattern**: Simplifies construction of complex objects (`ParkingSpot`, `Ticket`), making the system easier to maintain and extend with new attributes.
- **Singleton Pattern**: Ensures a single `ParkingLot` instance, critical for centralized state management in a multi-gate system.
- **Observer Pattern**: Enables scalable real-time updates for availability (e.g., `DisplayBoard`, mobile apps), supporting multiple observers without tight coupling.
- **Strategy Pattern**: Provides flexibility for payment modes (cash, card, UPI) and billing (hourly, minute), allowing easy addition of new strategies (e.g., subscription-based billing).
- **Thread-Safe Design**: `ConcurrentHashMap` and `ReentrantLock` ensure scalability for high-concurrency scenarios with multiple gates.

This hybrid design maximizes scalability (new vehicle types, observers, payment modes), maintainability (clear separation of concerns), and performance (thread-safe operations), fully addressing all requirements while adhering to SOLID principles.
